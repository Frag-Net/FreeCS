# FreeCS
Clean-room reimplementation of Counter-Strike 1.5 (mod-version).

Aiming for a stable reimagining of the original mod in QuakeC.
Not aiming for accuracy, but for a smooth, exploit and bug-free
experience over the Internet.

This is all 100% new, original code written by good old trial and error.
Differences exist and features are slowly being implemented one by one.
This allows the code to be fully free and unencumbered, unlike similar projects.

Featuring proper weapon prediction to enable stress-free netplay.

## Building
Clone the repository into the Nuclide-SDK:

> git clone REPOURL cstrike

then either run Nuclide's ./build_game.sh shell script, or issue 'make' inside
./cstrike/src!

Obviously make sure that Nuclide has fteqw and fteqcc set-up for building.
